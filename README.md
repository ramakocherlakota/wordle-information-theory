- wordle solver and guesser

- would be nice to have a method/script to dump out all the possibles after some guesses
  - basically just guess_table
  - but you need one for quordle as well

- is this really the best strategy?
  - can't argue with luck: smite solved by raise / cloth / smite 
  - is it realistic?  can a person easily master it?
  - specify first two guesses instead of first quess

- what about hard mode - is it that much harder?
  - often the bot is guessing too far ahead, trying to maximize information for the next guess rather than trying to guess the word
    - needed special code to force it to guess a word when it was the only one left that fit
    - however, in hard mode you can end up in blind alleys (need an example)
  - run all the words in hard mode and non-hard mode

- quordle

- solver and guesser

- mastermind mode

- using the code
  - create and load schema
  - python code
